# Space Conflcits - Empires - Old Java Prototype
To build and run this appliation you need:

- (open)JDK 1.8
- [SingularityEngine](https://github.com/Z-Ray-Entertainment/SingularityEngine)
- [ZGUI](https://github.com/Z-Ray-Entertainment/ZGUI)
- [CoreText](https://github.com/Z-Ray-Entertainment/CoreText)
- [SELibs](https://github.com/Z-Ray-Entertainment/SELibs)

After building run the applicaion as follows: `java -Djava.library.path="./lin64" -jar "./space_conflicts_empires.jar"`
Actually I have no clue how I bunbled the distribution prefixes back then. Simply look at this [preset](https://github.com/Z-Ray-Entertainment/SingularityEngine/tree/master/data/prefix).  
Maybe it is already enough to then run the newly build thing.
