# Space Conflcits - Empires - Old Java Prototype
To build and run this appliation you need:

- (open)JDK 1.8
- [SingularityEngine](https://github.com/Z-Ray-Entertainment/SingularityEngine)
- [Singularity Engine Renderer Legacy OpenGL](https://github.com/Z-Ray-Entertainment/se-render-legacy-opengl)
- [ZGUI](https://github.com/Z-Ray-Entertainment/ZGUI)
- [CoreText](https://github.com/Z-Ray-Entertainment/CoreText)
- [SELibs](https://github.com/Z-Ray-Entertainment/SELibs)

After building run the applicaion as follows: `java -Djava.library.path="./lin64" -jar "./space_conflicts_empires.jar"`  
Actually I have no clue how I bunbled the distribution prefixes back then. Simply look at this [preset](https://github.com/Z-Ray-Entertainment/SingularityEngine/tree/master/data/prefix).  
Maybe it is already enough to then run the newly build thing.

## Notice
This is not the source code of the game as shwon in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pYG6aQe1v4). As this is a new revision after splitting game and engine code into seperate projects.  
The original original source code unfortuanlety got lost. But you may recive it by de-compiling the old jars from [here](404).
